# azcopy folder

The AzCopy binaries were kept in this folder so that they are made accessible in the container by cloning this repo. This was done for convenience when doing the end-to-end testing that includes reading data from Azure. You should install AzCopy into your environment yourself.

To use AzCopy, install it in your container. See [Get started with AzCopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10) for details.
